The package subfiles has already been loaded with options:
  [../block_diagram_intro/block_diagram_intro.tex]
There has now been an attempt to load it with options
  [../../../patent_v1.tex]
Adding the global options:
  ../block_diagram_intro/block_diagram_intro.tex,../../../patent_v1.tex
to your \documentclass declaration may fix this.
Try typing  <return>  to proceed.

Dimensions can be in units of em, ex, in, pt, pc,
cm, mm, dd, cc, nd, nc, bp, or sp; but yours is a new one!
I'll assume that you meant to say pt, for printer's points.
To recover gracefully from this error, it's best to
delete the erroneous units; e.g., type `2' to delete
two letters. (See Chapter 27 of The TeXbook.)
