As discussed in methodology, as the speakers propagates sound in oval. Hence shape we need to align 
the major axis of the sound field towards the listener.

Mechanical units assembles with, two servo motors for each speaker (channel)
one for panning and second for tilting.

Servos are connected to hardware PWM pins of the RPi and controlled in real time using feedback 
of the angle algorithm.
