As discussed in the methodology, the speakers propagates sound in elliptical. Hence we need 
to align the major axis of the sound field towards the listener.

The mechanical unit is consisting of two servo motors
for each speaker (channel), one for panning and the second
for tilting,

Servos are connected to hardware PWM pins of the RPi and controlled in real time using feedback 
of the angle algorithm.
