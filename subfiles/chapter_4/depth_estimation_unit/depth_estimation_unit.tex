Depth estimation unit includes stereo vision assembly of two web cams with similar 
(known or unknown) focal length (In our case 18 cm).

The cameras are placed at some known distance \(x \) from each other (24 cm) and 
computer vision (opencv) and geometrical equations have been implemented to measure the 
depth, deviation and height of an object from a reference point, where the reference point 
is the center of the stereo vision system.
