High-end audio systems provide very high-quality sound, and it also provides the 
user with the feasibility to use them for multiple events. But even the best has 
some drawbacks.

\begin{description}
    \item[-]The complexity of hardware, as per the research study, we can observe 
    the research is based on mono channel and not multi-channel. 
    \item[-]Research suggests the use of Kinect for object tracking, which comes 
    with its drawbacks.
    \item[-]The Algorithm's complexity to achieve the effect, researchers suggested 
    very complex algorithms regardless of room geometry. Hence, they are challenging 
    to understand and hard to implement on low-cost hardware.
