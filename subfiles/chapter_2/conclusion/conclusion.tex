\begin{description}
    \item[-]Complexity of Hardware, as per the research study we can 
            observe the research is based on mono channel and not multi channel. 
    \item[-]Research suggests use of kinect for object tracking which have its 
            own drawbacks.
    \item[-]Complexity of Algorithm, to achieve the effect researchers suggested 
            very complex algorithms regardless of room geometry.
