To explain the problem statement briefly, consider a real-life scenario. I 
configured the orientation and volume levels of my sound system to get perfect 
surround sound at some position where I usually seat. However, now I want to 
change my seating position or even arrangement to some other part of my room 
which can be far right or left or may be forward or backward from the last seating 
arrangement. In this case, to get perfect surround sound, I need to reconfigure my 
speakers again, like their orientation and volume levels as per the new seating 
position either with the technician or self's help, which is mostly manual adjustments.

To overcome this scenario, we experimented with a combination of stereo vision and 
hardware technology which responds to real-time movements of a listener and dynamically 
adjust the sound pocket. This system uses the OpenCV face detection algorithm and 
simple geometrical formula to calculate depths and angles for an individual speaker 
to introduce dynamically adjusted surround sound. Since the system avoids the heavy 
usage of hardware, complex algorithms, and machine learning approaches, it can be 
implemented on low-powered microprocessors and the same processors used by sound systems.
