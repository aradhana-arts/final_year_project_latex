To explain the problem statement briefly, 
consider a real life scenario, I configured the 
orientation and volume levels of my sound system in 
order to get perfect surround sound at some 
position where I usually seat. But, now I want 
to change my seating position or even arrangement 
to some other part of my room which can be far 
right or left or may  be forward  or backward 
from the last seating arrangement. In this case 
to get perfect surround  sound I need to 
reconfigure my speakers again, that is, its 
orientation and volume levels as per the new 
seating position either with the help of technician 
or self which is mostly manual adjustments.

To overcome this scenario we experimented a combination of 
stereo vision and hardware technology which responds to real time
movements of listener and dynamically adjust the sound pocket. This system
uses opencv face detection algorithm and simple geometrical formula to
calculate depths and angles for individual speaker to introduce dynamically
adjusted surround sound. Since the system avoids the heavy usage of hardware, complex
algorithms and machine learning approach it can be implemnted on low powered
micorprocessors as well same processors used by sound systems.
