To explain the problem statement briefly, consider a real-life scenario. A person 
configured the orientation and volume levels of my sound system to get perfect 
surround sound at some position where he usually sit. However, he wants to 
change his sitting position or even arrangement to some other part of room 
which can be far right or left or may be forward or backward from the last sitting 
arrangement. In this case, to get perfect surround sound, he will need to reconfigure  
speakers again (their orientation and volume levels) as per the new seating 
position, either with the assistance of a technician or on his own, which are mostly 
manual adjustments.

To overcome this scenario, we experimented with a combination of stereo vision and 
hardware technology which responds to real-time movements of a listener and dynamically 
adjust the sound pocket. This system uses the OpenCV face detection algorithm and 
simple geometrical formula to calculate depths and angles for an individual speaker 
to introduce dynamically adjusted surround sound. Since the system avoids the heavy 
usage of hardware, complex algorithms, and machine learning approaches, it can be 
implemented on low-powered microprocessors and the current processors which are being used by 
sound systems.
